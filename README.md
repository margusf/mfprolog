========

This is simple Prolog interpreter, written so that I could learn about Prolog and OCaml. It uses continuation-passing style for managing control flow.

Currently it is in need of redesign as the current grammar and language are too narrow. In particular, the AND operator (,) should be made regular operator instead of special language construct.
